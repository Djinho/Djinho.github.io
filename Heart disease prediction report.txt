Report: Logistic Regression for Heart Disease Prediction
Overview
This project leverages a logistic regression model to predict heart disease presence based on various health indicators. The aim is to develop a reliable classifier that can assist in early diagnosis and intervention.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed using Pandas for data manipulation and StandardScaler for feature scaling.
Data is split into training and test sets with train_test_split from scikit-learn, ensuring a balanced representation of the target variable.
Model Training
A logistic regression classifier is trained on the dataset, implemented using scikit-learn's LogisticRegression.
Model Evaluation
The model's accuracy is evaluated on both training and test sets using the accuracy_score metric from scikit-learn.
Results
The logistic regression model obtained a training accuracy of 94.75%, demonstrating excellent learning from the training data.
The model achieved a test accuracy of 93%, indicating strong predictive performance on unseen data.
Dependencies
