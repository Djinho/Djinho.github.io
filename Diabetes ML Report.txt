 Report: Support Vector Machine for Diabetes Prediction
Overview
This project involves the development of a predictive model based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to identify the presence of diabetes in individuals. Utilizing a dataset with health-related features, the SVM classifier is trained and evaluated to measure its performance.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing
The data is standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that the SVM algorithm receives data without bias due to variable scales.
The dataset is split into a training set and a test set with a ratio of 70:30 using train_test_split, stratified by the outcome variable to maintain the proportion of classes.
Model Training
An SVM classifier with a linear kernel is trained on the standardized data.
Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on both the training and test data using the accuracy_score metric.
Results
The SVM model achieved a training accuracy of approximately 78.02%, indicating that the classifier has a good fit on the training data.
On the test dataset, the model showed a test accuracy of approximately 77.49%, suggesting that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.
Dependencies
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
scikit-learn (for machine learning functionalities including StandardScaler, train_test_split, svm, and accuracy_score)
